# Survey master
This is a simple web application that was made in Angular 5 and expressjs. The goal of this application is for the user to answer random surveys. These surveys can be defined by the users themselves and can only have 2 answers, a red and a blue one. After answering a survey the user can see what the other users answered. The users can also comment on these surveys and upvote other comments. This application was made for a school project and is free to use by anybody as long as there is a reference to my github.

## Running the application

The app requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your computer. After that you can start the project by running these commands:

For installing the dependencies
```
npm install
```

For starting the project
```
npm start
```

Execute these 2 commands for both the frontend and backend. You should be able to reach the site with `localhost:4200` and the backend with `localhost:3000`

## Extra information
The application works with MongoDB (NoSQL). It is important that you create your own database for this and connect it to the express backend. A site recommended for a free database is  [mLab](https://mlab.com/).

You can visit a hosted version of this project on https://surveyymaster.herokuapp.com/
